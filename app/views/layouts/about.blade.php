            <p>Technothlon is an international school championship organized by the student fraternity of IIT Guwahati.
                Technothlon began in 2004 in a small room with an aim to &quot;Inspire Young Minds&quot;. Starting on
                our journey with a participation of 200 students confined to the city of
                Guwahati, over the past 10 years we have expanded our reach to over 200 cities all over India and
                various centers abroad. The championship is organized over 2 rounds:<br>
                1. Prelims: a written preliminary examination which takes place in numerous schools all over India in the month of July<br>
                2. Mains: an event based competition which is conducted at IIT Guwahati, among the top 100 students from each squad.</p>

            <h2>Aim</h2>

            <p>Through a series of events involving mental aptitude, logic, and dexterity,
                we seek to provide school students a platform to build fundamental experience and knowledge, to
                exercise co-ordination skills, and to think out of the box.</p>

            <p>Prelims is in general a subjective + objective written exam. It involves no syllabus or general
                knowledge and relies solely on the student's logical and analytical thinking abilities. The exam

                puzzles, code crunchers etc. Each section has its own marking scheme. It is held at
                selected cities on the 3rd Sunday of the month of July.</p>
